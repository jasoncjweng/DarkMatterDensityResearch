Dark Matter Density Research
This repository contains research on the estimation of dark matter density using machine learning models. The goal of the project was to develop and optimize a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze and model dark matter density distributions in astrophysical simulations. The work is based on a large set of simulation data, which is used to train the model in order to predict dark matter density at various points in space.

Key Components:
Data: The model uses simulated 3D data sets representing different regions of the universe with varying dark matter distributions.
Model: A 3D CNN was trained to capture spatial features and learn complex patterns in the data, enabling predictions of dark matter density.
Optimization: Model performance was improved using TensorBoard for visualization of training metrics, such as loss and accuracy, to fine-tune hyperparameters.
